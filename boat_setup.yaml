# Parameters used to set up the Simulator class. There 2 types of parameters the simulator the boat can have:
# Boat attributes: Characteristics of the boat such as the width, height, etc.
# Hyper parameters: Certain parameters used for the code such as the acceptable distance to waypoint, distance when to
# change the speed, etc.
# All the parameters should be documented when defined. If you any add any new parameters please do comment
# and explain what is used for and where is used.



# Boat parameters
boat_attributes:
  # boat parameters used to simulate the correct dimensions of the boat. If the boat is treated as a point
  # then all dimension are 0. in the current version they are not used yet.
  dimensions:
     # boat's height.
     height: 0

     # boat's width.
     width: 0

     # boat's length.
     length: 0


# Hyper Parameters
hyper_parameters:
  # Acceptance radius of a waypoint (in meters).
  acceptance_radius: 10

  # Speed parameters for the boat (in meters per second).
  speed:
     # speed while maintaining a straight line on track
     on_track: 5

     # speed while turing after reaching a waypoint
     while_turning: 1

  # Distance parameters when to change the speed (in meters).
  distance:
     # Keep a defined speed for a while after the last waypoint has been reached.
     after_last_waypoint: 3

     # Keep a defined speed for a while after until the current waypoint is reached.
     before_current_waypoint: 15

  # Initial position if necessary (in DMM format). If not known, set to [0,0].
  initial_position: [5050.708799, 44.755897]
